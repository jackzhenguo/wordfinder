        This method mainly does the train job, and train strategy is via udpipe
        or NLTK or other train strategies.

        About the train corpus, if it's very large, then loading memory possibly
        causes memory overflow. Thus, it's more reasonable to load each sentence to
        memory one after one.

        After loading one sentence with specific :param{language_name}, it's likely
        that calling self.clean_data method does the clean to this sentence. Then,
        by loading pre-train model with specific :param{language_name}, we get each
        word and word's POS of this sentence.

        The result for this sentence would cache to TResult model we define,
        then appennding a list. Finally, ruturn this list.
